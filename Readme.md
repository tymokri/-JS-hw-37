DOM V2.
We have a tree structured as nested ul/li lists.
1. Use a for... of and write the value of each attribute ul to an array — output that array to the console.
2. Also write each attribute name to a separate array — output that array to the console.
3. Use JS to change the text in the last li tag.
4. Add the 'data-my-name' attribute to the first li element with a value that contains your name.
5. Remove from the tag ul attribute 'data-dog-tail'.
